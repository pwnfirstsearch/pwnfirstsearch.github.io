This was a really fun x64 Linux ELF reversing challenge that ended up scoring
189 points with 56 solves. I learned how printf can be extended at runtime,
different disassembly techniques, and the power of dynamic tracing! Overall, I
had a lot of fun with this one and I'm glad I didn't give up on it :)

## Taking a look in Ghidra

The first step I took was loading `weather` in [ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)
and locating `main`.

### Main

![Decompiling the main function](/assets/img/google-21/main1.png)

Main reads user input, and initializes some structs based on string matching
against a few hardcoded city names. After initializing the `wind`, `precip`, and
`temp` structs, it displays that information using `printf` and some weird
format specifiers I hadn't seen before.

![Decompiling the rest of the main function](/assets/img/google-21/main2.png)

And finally, at the end there is a call to printf that looks very interesting:

```c
    printf("Flag: %F\n"), flag);
```

Here's a simple interaction with the binary:

```
Welcome to our global weather database!
What city are you interested in?
Miami
Weather for today:
Precipitation: 100ml of sweat
Wind: 1km/h NE
Temperature: 31337Â°F
Flag: none
```

### Custom printf formatting

After checking out main, I clicked through the initialization functions
`_INIT_0` and `_INIT_1` since there must be something happening before main to
make printf work this way.

![Decompiling Init 1](/assets/img/google-21/init.png)

There are a dozen calls to `register_printf_function` which is a GNU extension
to the C standard library
[documented here](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Customizing-Printf.html).
In short, the parameters to know about this function are:

```c
register_printf_function(
    // The character that triggers this handler.
    // (e.g. the 'F' in %F for the flag handler)
    char specifier,
    // The function to call when the specifier is found.
    // Note, it's not really void* but nobody has time to
    // remember C's function pointer syntax, and void*
    // works pretty much anywhere when you want to be lazy.
    void* handler,
    // Also a function pointer. This tells printf how many
    // arguments are consumed when this specifier is used.
    void* arginfo);
```

Looking at `_INIT_1`, I recognized W, P, T, and F from main, and according to
their `arginfo` function, they all consume one argument. This makes sense, after
all; in `printf("%s %d", "hello", 4);` you would expect `"%s"` to consume the
first argument `"hello"`, then `"%d"` can consume the next argument 4. Here's
how the custom formatter formats the `wind` struct:

```c
struct wind {
    int amount;
    char* direction;
};

int Wind(FILE *fd, undefined8 param_2, wind ***wind) {
  return fprintf(fd,"%dkm/h %s",(**wind)->amount,(**wind)->direction);
}
```

However, the remaining handlers consume zero arguments. The first of these weird
formatters is actually found in the `"%F"` handler:

```c
int FUN_001022aa(FILE *param_1,undefined8 param_2,undefined8 *param_3) {
  return fprintf(param_1,"%52C%s",**param_3);
  //                      ^^^^
}
```

Ah! So the `"%C"` consumes no arguments, leaving the `"%s"` to handle the one
argument passed in, which will be printed as a string. When called from main,
this argument is a global variable. In ghidra's listing view, I saw that it
couldn't detect any other xrefs besides from main:

![XRefs to flag global](/assets/img/google-21/flag_global.png)

Next I looked at a few other formatters, starting with `"%C"`. Every formatter
has a similar declaration:

```c
int printf_handler(
    // FILE handle to write to
    FILE* file,
    // Format specifiers, like precision and max width to print
    printf_info* info,
    // arguments available to consume (varargs)
    ...);
```

And that `printf_info` struct is pretty important too:

```c
/* from /usr/include/printf.h */
struct printf_info
{
  int prec;                      /* Precision.  */
  int width;                     /* Width.  */
  wchar_t spec;                  /* Format letter.  */
  unsigned int is_long_double:1; /* L flag.  */
  unsigned int is_short:1;       /* h flag.  */
  unsigned int is_long:1;        /* l flag.  */
  unsigned int alt:1;            /* # flag.  */
  unsigned int space:1;          /* Space flag.  */
  unsigned int left:1;           /* - flag.  */
  unsigned int showsign:1;       /* + flag.  */
  unsigned int group:1;          /* ' flag.  */
  unsigned int extra:1;          /* For special use.  */
  unsigned int is_char:1;        /* hh flag.  */
  unsigned int wide:1;           /* Nonzero for wide character streams.  */
  unsigned int i18n:1;           /* I flag.  */
  unsigned int is_binary128:1;   /* Floating-point argument is ABI-compatible
                                    with IEC 60559 binary128.  */
  unsigned int __pad:3;          /* Unused so far.  */
  unsigned short int user;       /* Bits for user-installed modifiers.  */
  wchar_t pad;                   /* Padding character.  */
};
```

When a format string like `"%-3.6lC"` is handed to the `"%C"` handler, printf
has already parsed out the modifiers into something like:

```c
struct printf_info
{
  int prec = 6,
  int width = 3,
  wchar_t spec = 'C',
  unsigned int is_long:1 = 1,    /* l flag.  */
  unsigned int left:1 = 1,       /* - flag.  */
  /* other bits in bitfield set to 0 */
  unsigned short int user = 0,
  wchar_t pad = '\0',
};
```

Ghidra is awful at displaying bitfields in the decompiler, but a workaround is
to define an equally sized enum, with specific names for each bit position. Then
it looks a little better.

![Using ghidra's enum editor](/assets/img/google-21/enum_editor.png)

Eventually, after staring at the `"%C"` and `"%E"` handlers long enough, I knew
each printf handler was some sort of virtual machine instruction that operated
on global memory. `"%C"` modified control flow, by calling `fprintf` recursively
at some offset from the base program.

The first instruction was `"%52C"` as called from the `"%F"` flag formatter.

Another important global buffer is the space where temporary values were read
from and stored. My first guess for this buffer was a stack, but it made more
sense as an array that holds register state.

![Annotated %C handler](/assets/img/google-21/call_handler.png)

![Annotated %E handler](/assets/img/google-21/xor_handler.png)

The arithmetic instructions all have a source, and a destination. Each operand
can be a direct memory offset from the program base, a register, or using a
register as a pointer to memory. They all parse how to operate on the source and
destination operands, then apply some arithmetic.

## First Disassembler

To figure out the virtual program that printf was executing, I wrote a
disassembler. The task was to read the program string:

```
%52C%s\0%3.1hM%3.0lE%+1.3lM%1.4llS%3.1lM%3.2lO%-7.3C\0%0.4096hhM%0.255llI%1.0lM%1.8llL%0.1lU%1.0lM%1.16llL%0.1lU%1.200llM%2.1788llM%7C%-6144.1701736302llM%0.200hhM%0.255llI%0.37llO%0200.0C\0
```

...and figure out what it means in this virtual machine.
[The disassembler source is provided here with documentation](
https://github.com/evanrichter/googlectf-2021-weather/blob/main/src/main.rs).
A commented version of an early disassembly attempt follows:

```
addr  source                inst

                            operation   dest, source  ("intel" syntax)

                    entry_point:
   0:                       jmp  --> 0x34         (jmp to start)

                    xor_loop:
                      r0: xor key (e.g. 0xabababab)
                      r1: buffer start
                      r2: buffer end
0x07: %3.1hM                mov  r3, [r1]
0x0d: %3.0lE                xor  r3, r0
0x13: %+1.3lM               mov  [r1], r3
0x1a: %1.4llS               add  r1, 0x4
0x21: %3.1lM                mov  r3, r1
0x27: %3.2lO                sub  r3, r2
0x2d: %-7.3C                jn   r3 --> 0x7     (jump to 7 if r3 is negative)

                    start:
0x34: %0.4096hhM            mov  r0, [0x1000]   (user input!)

                    take first byte of user input: 0xab and make it 0xabababab
0x3e: %0.255llI             and  r0, 0xff
0x47: %1.0lM                mov  r1, r0
0x4d: %1.8llL               shl  r1, 0x8
0x54: %0.1lU                or   r0, r1
0x5a: %1.0lM                mov  r1, r0
0x60: %1.16llL              shl  r1, 0x10
0x68: %0.1lU                or   r0, r1      <- xor key
0x6e: %1.200llM             mov  r1, 0xc8    <- start xoring here
0x77: %2.1788llM            mov  r2, 0x6fc   <- end xoring here
0x81: %7C                   jmp   --> 0x7

0x84: %-6144.1701736302llM  mov  [0x1800], 0x656e6f6e    (string "none")
0x98: %0.200hhM             mov  r0, [0xc8]      <- read byte of next program
0xa1: %0.255llI             and  r0, 0xff
0xaa: %0.37llO              sub  r0, 0x25        <- check if it's a '%'!
                                                    xor key must be 0x54
0xb2: %0200.0C              jz   r0 --> 0xc8   (jump to 0xc8 if r0 is zero)
```

The instructions made just enough sense to figure out what it was: an xor
decoder. Specifically, it reads the first byte of user input (0x1000 from
program base is where the user initially enters a city name). Then it starts at
0xc8 from the program base, and applies that input as an xor key up to 0x6fc
from the program base. Finally, it checks if the first byte xor'd ended up as a
'%'. If so, _it would jump there and keep executing more instructions!_

I was very glad I took the time to write a disassembler.

I found out later that every conditional or unconditional _jmp_ was really more
like a conditional or unconditional _call_. The `"%C"` handler calls `fprintf`,
which:

1. pushes a new stack frame (or 2 or 3...) onto the main Linux program stack
2. other custom handlers will execute instructions one after another
3. consume no actual arguments to printf
4. continue until `fprintf` encounters a nul at the end of the format string:
   `\0`

In this sense, there is one implicit `ret` instruction that doesn't have a
custom format handler, but is just the natural returning from a `fprintf` call
which happens at the `nul` terminator.

The stage 2 was very long, and I was getting tired of reading assembly. I wanted
to add instrumentation and print out what was going on dynamically. I first
tried to add break points using gdb, but I could only break on _every_ `add`
instruction when I really just wanted to break on a _certain_ `add` instruction
for example.

## Second Disassembler

I decided to rework my disassembler to emit useful pseudocode that I could then
compile as rust code. _(hey, everything else is being rewritten in rust,
right?)_

Here's a comparison of the old format to the new:

```
addr:     --old--               --new--
0x07:   mov  r3, [r1]         s.r3 = s.mem[s.r1 as u32 as usize];
0x0d:   xor  r3, r0           s.r3 ^= s.r0;
0x13:   mov  [r1], r3         [r1] = s.r3;
0x1a:   add  r1, 0x4          s.r1 += 0x4;
0x21:   mov  r3, r1           s.r3 = s.r1;
0x27:   sub  r3, r2           s.r3 -= s.r2;
0x2d:   jn   r3 --> 0x7       if s.r3 < 0 { label_0x07(&mut s); }
0x33:                         ret
                              ^^^ a NUL terminator was here!
```

The machine only ever used registers 0-4 and RW global memory, so everything
needed to represent virtual machine state is contained in this struct:

```rust
struct State {
    // registers
    r0: i32,
    r1: i32,
    r2: i32,
    r3: i32,
    r4: i32,
    // memory
    mem: Vec<u8>,
}
```

I had to manually fix up some of the ~~disassembler~~ transpiler output to
create working rust code. For example, any target of a function call had to be
an actual rust function. So I would separate that block under a new function,
and end at the next `ret` found. Every function had the same type signature, a
mutable reference to the `State`.

Memory accesses also had to be modified from the original syntax. Every VM read
or write is 4 bytes wide, but has no alignment restrictions. In rust, unaligned
memory access is undefined behavior. To get around this, and what turned out to
be a killer feature of this emulator, was to make memory accesses a method on
`State`.

```rust
impl State {
    // read 4 bytes from memory
    fn read(&mut self, src: i32) -> i32 {
        // log the mem read
        println!("reading <-- index {:x} {}", src, log_index(src));

        // index as usize
        let i = src as u32 as usize;
        // copy memory bytes into temp buf
        let mut buf = [0; 4];
        buf.copy_from_slice(&self.mem[i..i + 4]);
        // return value as little endian
        i32::from_le_bytes(buf)
    }

    // write is similar
}

// example of a fully transpiled function:
fn stage2_28d(s: &mut State) {
    s.r0 = 0x75bcd15;
    s.r1 = s.read(0x1000);
    s.r0 ^= s.r1;
    s.r2 = 0x3278f102;
    s.r2 ^= s.r0;
    /* ... */
}
```

With the virtual program in this state, it was much faster to iterate, reverse
engineer, and dynamically trace program state. You might have noticed the
`log_index` function used in `State::read()`. This function was invoked on every
memory access, read or write, and would tell me what buffer was being accessed.
As I reversed out where user input was stored, or where the final flag string
was being written, I would update this function.

```rust
fn log_index(index: i32) -> &'static str {
    match index {
        0x1000..=0x1100 => "[user input]",    // user input "city name"
        0x1190..=0x1290 => "[first pass]",    // input lands here after XOR and add operations
        0x1300..=0x1400 => "[RNG numbers]",   // this range was actually prime numbers but whatever
        0x1800..=0x1900 => "[flag output]",   // points to `flag` global addr in binary, see ghidra
        _ => "",
    }
}
```

I could print out registers as well, which came in handy, but not as much as
tracing memory and naming buffers.

Another killer feature of this approach was being able to quickly change the
program. The last function call was to 0x28d and was conditional. It wouldn't
always run. I, being curious, wanted to know what would happen if the program
did execute that function even if it wasn't supposed to. So I added an `else`
branch with a reminder that I was "cheating" by calling the function anyway:

```rust
    if s.r0 == 0 {
        // print flag?
        stage2_28d(s);
        println!("done with 28d");
    } else {
        println!("cheating");
        stage2_28d(s);
        println!("done cheating with 28d");
    }
```

That last function was conditional on r0 being zero. The second to last function
called set r0 by reading from an intermediate buffer, applying some static
arithmetic, and or-ing those values into r0. If any part of that intermediate
buffer was "wrong" then some bits in r0 will be set, and the final function
would not get called. I called this function `buffer_check`.

Having the code in rust let me quickly copy and paste `buffer_check` and create
another function `buffer_create`. I swapped out the OR instructions into memory
write instructions. This effectively let me extract the desired, or "good boy"
buffer into an easily read memory location.

## Reversing

After all that work instrumenting and reversing how the VM executes
instructions, it was a relatively quick matter to see what the program was doing
and how to provide a winning input.

First the program generated "RNG numbers" (really primes) that were always the
same. Then, it read user input until a NUL terminator. It then xor-ed that input
byte by an RNG byte. Then it took the index of that input, and added the number
of steps to reach 1 following the
[Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
rules (btw Dirk just made a
[great video on that subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)).

In pseudo code, the input-check algorithm is:

```rust
rng_numbers = [.....];
user_input =  [.....];
first_pass;
for ii in 0..user_input.len() {
    first_pass[ii] = (rng_numbers[ii] ^ user_input[ii]) + collatz(ii);
}

if first_pass ^ create_buffer() == 0 {
    win();
}
```

## Solving

I used the emulator to finally solve for the correct input value, and place that
input string where user input is expected.
[Full emulation code here](https://github.com/evanrichter/googlectf-2021-weather/blob/main/src/ex.rs).

```rust
pub fn run() {
    // default inits everything to 0 which is fine, I manually checked for any register reads that
    // could have been uninitialized
    let mut s = State::default();

    // copy program bytes (program bytes exported from ghidra)
    s.mem = include_bytes!("../mem").to_vec();
    // extend out to include any reads/writes
    s.mem.extend(&[0; 8000]);

    // reverse the flag arithmetic and final check
    {
        // make the goodboy buffer
        buffer_create(&mut s);
        let goodboy = s.mem[0x1194..0x1194+0x1c].to_vec();
        println!("goodboy {:x?}", goodboy);

        // make the rng numbers buffer
        generate_buffer(&mut s);
        let numbers = s.mem[0x1388..0x1388+38*2].to_vec();
        println!("numbers {:x?}", numbers);

        // get some collatz numbers
        let mut collatz_nums = Vec::new();
        for c in 0..0x1c {
            s.r0 = c + 1;
            collatz(&mut s);
            collatz_nums.push(s.r0 as u8);
        }
        println!("collatz {:x?}", collatz_nums);

        // generate the winning input
        let mut winning_bytes = Vec::new();
        for ii in 0..0x1c {
            let a = goodboy[ii].wrapping_sub(collatz_nums[ii]) ^ numbers[ii*2];
            winning_bytes.push(a);
        }

        // put the right stuff into user input
        s.mem[0x1000..0x1000+winning_bytes.len()].copy_from_slice(&winning_bytes);
        let input = String::from_utf8(s.mem[0x1000..0x101c].to_vec()).unwrap();
        println!("Winning input: {}", input);
    }

    // run the original virtual machine code
    stage2_main(&mut s);

    // extract the flag out of the machine memory
    let s = String::from_utf8(s.mem[0x1800..0x1820].to_vec()).unwrap();
    println!("Flag: {}", s);
}
```
