# Lost in Your Eyes

Solved by: oneup, papa

## Description

```
Your eyes are like a maze, and I hate mazes, so help me escape.

nc dicec.tf 31578
```

## Initial

We connect to the service specified and get absolutely no output. If we send
a little bit of data only then does the service send any data:

`:(`

## Reversing the service

Time to pop it into IDA. There aren't very many functions except for one huge
one that immediately grabs our attention at 0x1420:

![Disassembly of step function](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/step_disas.png)

## Virtual machine

From the giant switch statement, it looks like we're dealing with some kind of
homebrew VM here. The opcodes are pretty short and sweet and we can quickly
determine the overall machine structure.

Registers:

* R0-R7: General purpose registers. R0 and R1 are also generally used for
memory addresses and R6 and R7 are used for binary operations.
* RNDX: An index register that can be used to select one of R0-R7.
* PC: 16-bit register denoting current program location.
* UNK: Some unknown register that can be saved and restored, or set to one
of four specific values.

Opcodes:

* `00: nop`
* `01-08: RNDX = <opcode> - 01`
* `09-10: R[RNDX] = R<opcode - 09>`
* `11-12: {++, --}R[RNDX]`
* `13-17: R[RNDX] = R6 {+, -, *, /, %} R7`
* `18-19: R[RNDX] = {~, -} R[RNDX]`
* `1A-1C: R[RNDX] = R6 {&, |, ^} R7`
* `1D-1E: R[RNDX] = R6 {==, <} R7`
* `1F: R0,R1 = PC; R2 = UNK`
* `20: skip 1 instruction if R[RNDX] & 1`
* `21: R[RNDX] = MEM[R0,R1]`
* `22: MEM[R0,R1] = R[RNDX]`
* `23: PC = R0,R1; UNK = R2`
* `24: R[RNDX] = getchar()`
* `25: putc(R[RNDX])`
* `26-29: UNK = <opcode> - 26`
* any other opcode ends the VM immediately

Finally, we can also reverse the ultimate goal needed to get the flag: make the
VM print out the characters `:)` and the interpreter will open and display the
flag.

## The unknown register

But what does that unknown register do? It seems the main place that it's used
is in the PC update code in 0x18D0, called after each call to the interpreter step
function 0x1420:

![Disassembly of PC update code](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/pc_update_disas.png)

A careful look reveals something surprising: the two 8-bit halves of PC are
updated independently! The bottom 8 bits don't carry over into the top 8 when
they overflow. And now looking at how that that unknown register is used makes
sense: value 0 decrements PC_LO each step, value 1 increments PC_HI each step,
value 2 increments PC_LO each step, and value 3 decrements PC_HI each step.

This little wrinkle also has huge ramifications on the structure of this
machine. Code is divided into 256-byte banks: reaching the end of one wraps
you back to the beginning, it doesn't proceed to the next one automatically.
In some ways this is similar to segment registers in the original 8086, or
memory banks in early game consoles like the NES or the Game Boy.

## Disassembling

We also see a huge section of memory at 0x40A0 that is the initial memory of
the VM. It's divided into 0x70 chunks of 0x70 bytes, where 0x70 bytes get
loaded to the beginning of one 0x100 bank, and then the next 0x70 bytes get
loaded to the beginning of the next 0x100 bank. The remaining banks from
0x70-0x100 are also left empty.

Using this we can write a basic disassembler using the table above, giving
us output like this:

```
BANK  0
   0: PCSTEPMODE = INC_HI
   1: PCSTEPMODE = DEC_LO
   2: PCSTEPMODE = DEC_HI
   3: R[NDX] = R6 * R7
   4: NOP
   5: NOP
   6: PC = R0,R1 ; PCSTEPMODE = R2
   7: ??? (0x3a)
   8: PCSTEPMODE = INC_HI
   9: R[NDX] = R1
  10: PCSTEPMODE = DEC_LO
  11: NOP
  12: NOP
  13: NOP
  14: NOP
  15: NOP
  16: NOP
  17: NOP
  18: NOP
  19: NOP
  20: NOP
  21: NOP
```

## Better representation?

It's a good start, but doesn't really capture how easy it is to move from one
bank to the next. After all, we might be stepping from 00:24 to 01:24 to 02:24
and it's pretty hard to look through each bank finding the right instruction.

It's almost like you can step horizontally through a bank or you can step
vertically from bank to bank. Almost like some kind of two dimensional thing?
Maybe this is where the problem description comes into play, referencing some
kind of maze. So what does it look like if we draw the opcodes on a 2-D grid?
We don't have enough room to spell out whole instructions in 2-D, but we can
put in some short mnemonics for a few opcodes, like arrow characters for the
opcodes that set the STEPMODE register. We code it up real fast and suddenly
we see:

![2-D representation of memory](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/2d_machine.png)

Whoa. Now we're getting somewhere.

Hey, speaking of mazes, is it just me or is that a maze in the top left corner?

## Emulation

But we still don't know a whole lot about what the program is doing, or what
input it's looking for. Let's write a quick little emulator to get some dynamic
introspection to see what's going on:

```
[ 0, 0] [ ,+] [00]  00   00   00   00   00   00   00         28 PCSTEPMODE = v

[24,12] [ ,-]  23  [13]  01   00   00   00   00   00         00 NOP
[24,11] [ ,-]  23  [13]  01   00   00   00   00   00         11 ++R[NDX]
[24,10] [ ,-]  23  [14]  01   00   00   00   00   00         11 ++R[NDX]
[24, f] [ ,-]  23  [15]  01   00   00   00   00   00         06 NDX = 5
[24, e] [ ,-]  23   15   01   00   00  [00]  00   00         09 R[NDX] = R0
```

It's still a LOT of stuff to go through, but now we can see a whole lot better
what's going on.

## Finding the right input

Setting the input to be 'xyz', we can run the emulator and see where it
rejects our input. Thankfully it's not too hard to find: the last 40 or so
instructions look like this:

```

There's the `:(` being printed out. And R4 has the first character of our
input, 'x'. Stepping back some more, we see that it's searching a table at
00:15 for each character of our input to see if it's in the table.

So what's in the table?

`00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 26 27 28 29 21 20`

Hmm... those are almost the same bytes that are valid opcodes...

So let's set our input to `\x01\x02\x03\x04 + (\x00 * 0x1000)` and run it to
see if we can get further.

But now it's looping endlessly, WTF? It seems to be bouncing back and forth
between 22:44 and 45:44, executing a string of 00 for all eternity:

Sure enough, it looks like we're giving it a program to execute. Some more
inspection reveals that our input is being used to fill the giant box in the
lower right corner of the memory map above:

![Memory map with our program loaded](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/input_location.png)

## Escaping the box

So now we can compare the table mentioned earlier to the actual opcode list and
see which opcodes we're prohibited from using:

* 1F: `R0,R1 = PC; R2 = STEPMODE`
* 22: `MEM[R0,R1] = R[RNDX]`
* 23: `PC = R0,R1; STEPMODE = R2`
* 24: `R[RNDX] = getchar()`
* 25: `putc(R[RNDX])`

So we can't do console I/O, we can't write to memory, and we can't jump. Then
how do we escape the box? There must be some way out. And indeed, examining the
top left corner reveals that there is a 1-instruction gap we can fit through.

(Interesting tangent: If you look through the interpreter code for the
conditional skip, you'll find there's quite a bit of code added to make sure
you're not skipping an instruction that sets STEPMODE to be 180 degrees from
the direction you're traveling. Our suspicion, which was later confirmed by the
organizers, was that this was to make sure you didn't "hop" the outer wall of
the box by conditionally skipping the instruction that sent you back into the
box.)

## Reaching the maze

Time to reverse what all is going on in the opcodes where you can leave the
jail.

*insert montage here*

Basically, each time you exit the maze, it iterates over one character in the
maze. If the current character is not 23 (far jump), then it will overwrite
the current character based on the value you loaded into R4 before exiting:

* 00: ^^
* 01: >>
* 02: vv
* 03: <<

Once it's iterated over the whole maze, it will transfer execution to it.
There's also 4 snippets included as part of the maze:

* `04 0F 07 11`: R3 = R6++
* `05 0F 07 11`: R4 = R6++
* `06 0F 07 11`: R5 = R6++
* `08 0F 07 11`: R7 = R6++

There's code after the maze that checks that we exit the maze with

`R3 = 0 | R4 = 1 | R5 = 2 | R7 = 3`

so we need to make sure we our path through the maze hits those 4 snippets
in the order listed above.

If we make it through the maze with those register values, then finally we get
to a region of code that prints out `:)`, which will trigger the interpreter to
give us our flag.

## Final program

So now all we need is a program that will load R4 with the right values when we
exit the maze. Thankfully the maze loading code leaves the current maze
position in R6:R7 when it returns execution to our code. So we can just include
our own 2-D copy of the values we want copied over to the maze, then write a
series of instructions along the frame to translate R6:R7 to index into our
program and use that to load R4:

![The final program loaded into memory](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/final_program.png)

![The maze representation in the final program](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/final_program_map.png)

![Translate R7 over to our map](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/final_program_xlate_r7.png)

![Translate R6 down to our map](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/final_program_xlate_r6.png)

![Load the value into R4](/assets/img/dice-21/lost/final_program_load_r4.png)

## Flag

Send the program to the service and we get the flag:

```
$ python solve.py

dice{2d_vms_ar3_tw1c3_the_d_of_1d_vms}
